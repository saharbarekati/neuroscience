collection of my neuroscience project 

## LIF_ELIF_AELIF

- file: "LIF_ELIF_AELIF.ipynb"

In this project, I implemneted the LIF, ELIF and Adaptive ELIF neuron models in python.

## groupNeuronModels

- file: "groupNeuronModels.ipynb"

With the LIF, ELIF, AELIF project, we implement a population of excitatory and Inhibitory neurons.

## snn

- file: "snn.py"

Consider a spiking neural network (SNN) that is a complete pattern of relation between input and output neurons.

## STDP

- file: stdp.py

The unsupervised learning STDP , showed the learning process by considering two neurons that are connected to each other.
